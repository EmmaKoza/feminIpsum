    <title>Lorem Ipsum</title>
    <!-- I was originally going to make this a feminist lorem ipsum generator but as with so many other projects, when it comes down to the last details, I lost interest. The functionality works but the dummy text I've written really is dumb. This doesn't mean that I'm less of a feminist or have abandoned the cause; It means that for the time being I prefer writing JavaScript than dummy-text sentences and I wanted a final(ish) project on my GitHub. Maybe one day I'll come back to this but probably not. You could check out the feminist Chrome Extension I created that replaces the word "guys" with a gender neutral term. -->
